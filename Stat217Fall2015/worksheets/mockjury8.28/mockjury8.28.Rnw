\large{STAT 217: Chapter 1, Testing Mockjury Data}
\end{center}

The courts are suspicious that unattractive females being sentenced for crimes tend to receive longer sentence lengths than defendants with average appearances. The MockJury dataset gives the sentence lengths for $75$ female defendants, some of which are unattractive, and some of which are average.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are our parameters of interest? Write them down in words and notation.
\vspace{0.75in}

\item What are our null and alternative hypotheses? Write them down in notation. 
\vspace{0.5in}

\item What are the two methods you learned to test this hypothesis?
\vspace{0.75in}

\item In 216 we used computer applets to make null distributions when we wanted to test our null hypothesis using randomization methods. In this class weâ€™re going to use R. But the idea is the same. Describe how the null distribution (aka the permutation distribution) is constructed.

require(heplots) ## telling R to load the package I need
data(MockJury) ## telling R to go grab the MockJury data set
MockJury <- subset(MockJury, select = c(Attr, Crime, Years, Serious, independent,
sincere)) ## selecting only the columns I'm interested in
MockJury2 <- subset(MockJury, Attr != "Beautiful")
## getting rid of observations from the Beautiul group
MockJury2$Attr <- factor(MockJury2$Attr, levels = c("Average", "Unattractive"))
## telling R to only keep those 2 levels of the Attr variable
rownames(MockJury2) <- 1:nrow(MockJury2) ## telling R to number the rows starting at 1

\item To build the permutation distribution in R, we are going to use a {\bf for loop}. Why is the {\bf for loop} needed?

\vspace{0.5in}

<<permdist, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE>>=
require(mosaic)
Tobs <- diffmean(Years ~ Attr, data = MockJury2) ## this is the observed diff in means
B <- 1000 ## this is how many permutations you want
Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow = B) ## setting up empty slots to put our permutation statistics in
for (b in 1:B) {
Tstar[b] <- diffmean(Years ~ shuffle(Attr), data = MockJury2) ## the bth permutation stat
## the text uses compareMean, but that is an outdated function
}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) ## telling R to put the two plots side by side
hist(Tstar)
abline(v = Tobs, lwd = 2) ## adding a line for the observed statistic
abline(v = -Tobs, lwd = 2)
plot(density(Tstar), main = "Density Plot of Tstar", xlab = "")
abline(v = Tobs, lwd = 2)
abline(v = -Tobs, lwd = 2)

\item What can you see from the above output? Do you think there is statistical evidence that unattractive women tend to receive longer sentences?
\vspace{0.75in}

\item The last piece of information we need for our hypothesis test is a p-value. We can get this from R using the following code. State your conclusion in the context of the problem.

<<pval, echo=TRUE>>=
pdata(abs(Tobs), abs(Tstar), lower.tail = F)
@

\item Interpret the p-value in the context of the problem.
