{\footnotesize Study explores how physical handicaps affect peopleâ€™s perception of employment qualifications. Researchers prepared 5 videotaped job interviews using actors with a script designed to reflect an interview with an applicant of average qualifications. The 5 tapes differed only in that the applicant appeared with a different handicap in each one. Seventy undergraduate students were randomly assigned to view the tapes and rate the qualification of the applicant on a 0-10 point scale. See the plot below. "Score" is the score each student gave to the applicant. "Handicap"is a factor variable with 5 levels.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Recall the handicap data from last class. I fit a linear model and the ANOVA is below. What type of model did I fit?
\begin{enumerate}[A]
\item Cell means model
\item Single mean model
\item Means only model
\item Reference coded model
\end{enumerate}

<<model1, echo=TRUE>>=
lm.1 <- lm(Score~Handicap, data=handicap.data)
anova(lm.1)

\item What are $N$ and $J$ in this example?
\vspace{.75in}

\item Look at the Mean Sq column in the ANOVA table above. Show how they calculated these numbers.
\vspace{.75in}

\item Now show how they calculated the F-statistic.
\vspace{.75in}

\item Think about what pieces go into the F-statistic. If the F-statistic is small, what does that suggest?
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the F-statistic is small, the deviation in the group averages around the grand mean is small compared to the variation in the responses around the group averages.
\item If the F-statistic is small, the separate means model is better. 
\item If the F-statistic is small, the deviation in the group averages around the grand mean is large compared to the variation in the responses around the group averages.
\item If the F-statistic is small, the variation in the responses around the group averages is small.
\end{enumerate}

\item At the $0.05$ significance level, what is your decision?
\vspace{0.5in}

\item Write your conclusion in the context of the problem.

\vspace{1in}

\item Based on your conclusion above, would you use a single mean model or a separate means model for these data?
\vspace{.25in}

\item Label the following formulas as SSE, SSA, or SST for the separate means model. \\ \\
$\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (y_{ij}-\bar{\bar{y}})^2$ \hfill
$\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (y_{ij}-\bar{y_j})^2$ \hfill
$\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (\bar{y_{j}}-\bar{\bar{y}})^2$ \\

\item EXTRA CREDIT (up to 10pts) Due Monday, September 15th. Think back to the formula you used to calculate variance ($\sigma^2$) in Stat $216$. Calculate $\sigma^2$ for the age-row data we collected in class today (I will post data to D2L). Find this quantity on the ANOVA table. What does $\sigma^2$ measure? Why do we see this quantity in the ANOVA table?
